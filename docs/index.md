# microsoftadcs Provider

This provider gives the ability to create certificates through a the Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) service.

## Example Usage 

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    microsoftadcs = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/flipyap/microsoft-adcs"
    }
  }
}

provider "microsoftadcs" {
  host = "server.company.local"
  username = "Username"
}
```

## Authentication

The provider supports kerberos and ntlm authentication methods. If you prefer ntlm, set the `use_ntlm` attribute. Otherwise you can use `krb5conf` attribute or the `ADCS_KRB5CONF` environment variable. The client in use also supports reading from the default `/etc/krb5.conf` file, but this is more of a last resort to try and support a wider range of application. Explicitly setting attributes is preferred for expected behavior.

### Environment Variables

```
ADCS_HOST
ADCS_USERNAME
ADCS_PASSWORD
ADCS_KRB5CONF
```
